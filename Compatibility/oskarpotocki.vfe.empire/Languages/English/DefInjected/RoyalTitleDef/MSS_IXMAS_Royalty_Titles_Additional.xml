    <VFEE_Magister.label>Head Elf</Freeholder.label>
    <VFEE_Magister.description>Father Christmas is more of a ceremonial role with little inherent political power other than that inherited from previous ranks. This is a title mostly reserved for the elderly and venerable, and is the highest earnable rank by elf-kind.</Freeholder.description>
    <VFEE_Despot.label>Saint Nicolas</Freeholder.label>

This role, though measurably less powerful, still dominates the Christmas empire's influence and power.</Freeholder.description>
